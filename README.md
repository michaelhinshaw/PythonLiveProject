# PythonLiveProject
Created A live web application using the Django Framework, Python Scripts, Javascript and SQL with intention of creating
a relational database.  I created an application that tracks important data about large objects in space.

The original goal was to create a relational database between Planets and their Moons.  The project then expanded
to gather relevant data about large stars in the universe as well.  

You can see a page of the application here http://michaelhinshaw.github.io/
I will be posting more photos and code very soon.

Using Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Python, and SQLlite I created models for each of the objects and their 
corresponding forms.  Django is a dynamic framework that allows for consistent content across pages in web applications, so 
that styling can be consistent as well as modular and dynamic.


I learned how to work as a part of a team on a larger scale project.  One skill that this project taught me, was a great deal of patience.  
I was forced to problem solve connections and routing on my own and it gave me confidence that if I look hard, I can find solutions to problems.
What didn't go so well during this project, was that I scaled the project too large for the time allowed during the coding sprint.  This resulted in not having enough time to vary the site, or add little details during the time allowed by the client.  I am happy with the outcome and I plan to turn it into a larger project.  I've been looking into using the AthenaCl extension from CSound to get algorithmic composition or sound design out of the data.
